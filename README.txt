	Program Information
==============================
Program is a basic shell that has extra commands add, args and muls implemented to it.
The code will account for commands with no arguments, and with arguments. The exception being that my muls command will only run if one or more args are entered. 

I don't have the hexidecimal working completley for the add function, it only works for single numbers 0x1-0xf. I think it has to do with my for loop before i check for the hex values (line 84). also did not get the & function working as i dont get running background processes without waiting, every time i tried i ended up getting zombie processes so i didnt want to risk it.

some possible improvements that could be made besides the missing support is I think i could have done the hex values a lot more efficiantly if i could have used the pow funciton from math.h

		Personalization
==============================
created a muls function that multiplies decimal numbers and displays the output.

		Assumptions
==============================
-number of characters per arg dont exceed 50.
- quotes can count as a argument
-assume that user will enter at least 1 argument to run my muls function
-assume appending to file with "> txtFile"
-assume that marks wont be taken off for lex file warnings (was told by a T.A)
